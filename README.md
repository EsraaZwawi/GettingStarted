Welcome! 
==========
If you're not familiar with git, follow the links bellow for a head start. Then test your git skills here, and put your first signature with us.

##What is Git?
Git is an open source distributed version control system (DVCS) that can significantly improve the way you work and collaborate on projects. It allows you to keep a history of the significant changes made to your local files. It can also backup this history through remote hosting services like GitHub. 


##Getting started with git:
- [Install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Setup git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
- [interactive tool to learn git](https://try.github.io)
- [check out the GitHub Webcasts on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyfwLX4HAxM&list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
- [Explains git overflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

##Your First Task:
- After setting up your git account, write your name and a short message if you like in the signature.md file!
- All you need to do is fork the repository, clone it to your computer, make your changes, commit, push and then send a pull request.
