#What is Git?
Git is an open source distributed version control system (DVCS) that can significantly improve the way you work and collaborate on projects. It allows you to keep a history of the significant changes made to your local files. It can also backup this history through remote hosting services like GitHub. 

#To contribute:
If you'll like to contribute to a project  all you need to do is fork the repository, clone it to your computer, make your changes, commit, push and then send a pull request.
